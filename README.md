In addition to the usual source and test files, you will be reading data from a file called `cheese_data.csv`. This file is included in the root of the directory. Feel free to move the file to wherever you want so that you can read the data from it.

1. Visit the [Gradle](https://gradle.org/install/) installation homepage.
2. Find your operatoring system, and follow the instructions to install Gradle.
